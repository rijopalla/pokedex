# Welcome!
This is my entry for Old.St Labs' Technical Assessment, as part of its internship program. The task is to create a simple catalogue webpage themed after Pokemon. 

# Functions
As of writing, the webpage has the following capabilities:
<ol>
    <li> Search </li>
    You can search for a Pokemon using its ID or Name
    <li> Detailed View </li>
    You can click on the Pokemon's card to show its ID, Name, Type Height, Weight, Abilities, Habitat, Base Stats, Weaknesses, and Description.
    <li> Sorting </li>
    You can choose how to sort the Pokemon shown by clicking on the buttons labeled <em>Sort Alphabetically </em> and <em>Sort By Number</em> at the bottom of the page.
</ol>
<br> 
The website currently shows 250 Pokemon (until Ho-oh).
